### Marketing Agency Website with Accessibility
This project is a codebase for a marketing agency website that prioritizes accessibility standards. The main objective is to optimize the website for search engines and ensure that it is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. By following accessibility guidelines, the website aims to provide a better user experience and improve its visibility in search engine rankings.

### Key Features
Semantic HTML Elements:
 The webpage uses meaningful HTML elements like headers, sections, articles, and more. These elements give structure and clarity to the content, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand.

### Logical Structure:
 The HTML elements are organized logically, irrespective of visual styles and positioning. This ensures smooth navigation for users who rely on assistive technologies.

### Accessible Images:
 All images and icons include descriptive alt attributes, providing alternative text for visually impaired users and improving overall accessibility.

### Sequential Headings:
 The heading elements follow a proper hierarchical order (h1, h2, h3, etc.), making it easier for users to comprehend the content structure and navigate through the webpage.

### Concise Title:
 The webpage has a concise and descriptive title, visible in the browser's title bar and search engine results. This title accurately represents the page's content and helps users understand its relevance before visiting.

By implementing these accessibility features, the marketing agency website aims to improve its search engine optimization and provide an inclusive browsing experience for all users.
